### 1. Overview
This API enables businesses to enhance their website search functionality using embeddings-based search. The API allows clients to:
- Submit product data for storage and embedding conversion.
- Perform intelligent search queries using natural language.
- Sync product updates in real time using webhooks.
### 2. Authentication
All endpoints require an API Key or JWT token for secure access. Clients must include an authentication header:
```Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

```
